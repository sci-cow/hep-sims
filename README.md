## A Repo of Experiments with Simulating High-Energy Physics Processes ##

This is a repo of the code I am using to play around with simulating various HEP processes. I'm not a particle physics researcher, and I am not affiliated with any accelerator collaboration. I'm just doing this off my own bat.
